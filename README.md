# Solace PubSub+ Event Portal Samples

## Overview
Solace PubSub+ Event Portal lets you design, create, discover, catalog, share, visualize, secure, and manage events and event-driven applications.  This repository contains samples that let you:
1. Get off the ground quickly and experience the power that Event Portal can bring to your use cases 
1. Offers a template for better practice
1. Gives you a place to share your Event Portal innovation with the greater community


## Getting started quickly
1. Select a use case that most closely applies to your situation.  For example, if you sell goods directly to consumers, retail might be a good place to start. Each subfolder of this repo is dedicated to a specific use case and contains further documentation of its operation.
2. Import the example domain into Event Portal using the [step-by-step instructions for importing a domain into Event Portal](https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/Event-Portal/event-portal-lp.htm) .
3. Explore the sample domain components.  Essential Event Portal concepts are [covered in the Event Portal overview](https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/Event-Portal/event-portal-overview.htm).
4. Once you understand the design of the sample domain, you can create the underlying run-time artifacts and see it running for real.  The artifacts vary by domain, but usually include a data stream generator that creates realistic sample events and a simple application that simulates transaction processing.

## Documentation
Each sample domain has individual documentation in a README.md file.

For more general documentation, see the [Event Portal documentation](https://docs.solace.com/Cloud/Event-Portal/event-portal-lp.htm).
