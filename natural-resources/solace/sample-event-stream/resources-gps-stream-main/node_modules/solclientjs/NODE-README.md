## INTRODUCTION
This is the Solace Node.js Messaging API. This API allows Node.js applications
to send messages to, and receive messages from, a Solace Messaging Router.

## SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
Solclientjs is supported in LTS versions of Node.js which are either active
or in maintenance.

## PACKAGING
The API is distributed either as the solclientjs package in the [npm](https://npmjs.org)
registry or as a downloadable tar.gz package named `npm-solclientjs-<version>.tar.gz`.
The package includes:
* `/lib` JavaScript module files
* `/docs` API online docs

## INSTALLATION
To install Solclientjs, with Node.js installed and `npm` present in your path:

### From the NPM registry
1. Change directory to where solclientjs will be installed
2. If package.json does not exist in the directory, create one with:
   `> npm init`
3. Install solclientjs:
   `> npm install solclientjs`

### From the downloadable package
1. Change directory to where solclientjs will be installed
2. If package.json does not exist in the directory, create one with:
   `> npm init`
3. Install solclientjs:
   `> npm install <path_to_package>/npm-solclientjs-<version>.tar.gz`

## SAMPLES
Tutorials and samples with detailed instructions how to run them, are
available on GitHub from the following location:

## API VARIATIONS
There are different variations of the API that can be used. The differences
between them include available logging verbosity and whether or not the API
has been minified.

When the available logging verbosity has been reduced, this is done to
improve the performance the application but this reduces the ability to
debug problems.

Minified libraries are both smaller and optimized for performance. However,
this comes at the expense of making debugging more difficult.

The following table summarizes the available API variations:

    | Variation  | Minified | Available Logs           |
    -------------|----------|---------------------------
    | Debug      | No       | All                      |
    | Full       | No       | INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL |
    | Production | Yes      | INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL |

To load an API variation, use one of the following statements:

        var solace = require('solclientjs');            // loads production
    OR  var solace = require('solclientjs').production; // loads production
    OR  var solace = require('solclientjs').full;       // loads full
    OR  var solace = require('solclientjs').debug;      // loads debug

## API PROFILES
The API has the concept of an initialization profile. The intent of the
profile is to allow old applications to remain compatible with old versions
of the API, while allowing new users to take advantage of new recommended
default behavior.

When writing a new application, it is recommended to choose the newest
factory profile. For example, if `version10` is the newest available factory
profile, this snippet demonstrates how to initialize the API:

    var factoryProps = new solace.SolclientFactoryProperties();
    factoryProps.profile = solace.SolclientFactoryProfiles.version10;
    solace.SolclientFactory.init(factoryProps);

For backwards compatibility with applications written before the concept of
API profiles were introduced, the default profile is `version7`.

__IMPORTANT__: `solace.SolclientFactory.init` should be called before any other API
function is invoked.

## LOGGING
The default log level of the API is `INFO`.  If you want to change the log
level, use the `solace.SolclientFactory#setLogLevel` method after calling
`solace.SolclientFactory#init`.

The following snippet shows how to load the debug API, select the `version10`
API profile, and set the log level to `TRACE`, the most verbose log level:

    var solace = require('solclientjs').debug;
    var properties = new solace.SolclientFactoryProperties();
    properties.profile = solace.SolclientFactoryProfiles.version10;
    solace.SolclientFactory.init(properties);
    solace.SolclientFactory.setLogLevel(solace.LogLevel.TRACE);
